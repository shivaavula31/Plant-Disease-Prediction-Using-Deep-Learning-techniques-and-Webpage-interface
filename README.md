# Plant-Disease-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-techniques-and-Webpage-interface
- download the dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nbhavith/tomatoleafdisease?rvi=1".
- In this project the diiferent deep learning models are trained using plant village dataset.
- Different accuracies and parameters are compared within different models.
- Some layers have been added to the models and changes are made , which improved the accuracy and other parameters(refer the above .ipynb notebooks).
- webpage is developed to interface trained model file i.e ".h5" to flask.
